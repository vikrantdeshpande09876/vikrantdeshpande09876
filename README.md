- üå± Always learning and growing as a [Data Scientist](https://github.com/vikrantdeshpande09876/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection)<sup><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/9c/01/319c01608b5b7d0d9b6b875f39ae6938.jpg">meme</a></sup>, and [Software Engineer](https://github.com/airavata-courses/scapsulators)<sup><a href="https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9340630784/h357E9FA4/text-when-you-write-10-lines-of-code-without-searching-on-google-itaint-much-but-its-honest-work">meme</a></sup>.
- üí¨ Ask me about the world of data or astrophysics, and I promise something interesting.
- üëØ Reach out if you're looking to collaborate on Machine Learning side projects, or need a partner for Leetcode problem-solving.
- ‚ú® Insert random inspirational quote: "The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take".
- ‚ö° I'm not always fun at parties:

```

### üî≠ Notable projects architected include:

1. An [NLP-based package](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/asctb-ct-label-mapper) to translate raw-labels into expert-approved naming-conventions, to establish controlled vocabulary within new annotated scRNA-seq datasets.
2. A [Credit Card fraud detection](https://github.com/vikrantdeshpande09876/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection) framework using Random-Forest models, deployed on GCP to monitor source-file changes using Cloud Functions and Airflow (Cloud Composer).
3. A Timeseries framework deployed on Azure ML as pipelines by using Facebook-Prophet and Seasonal-ARIMA models, and exogenous variables like `discounts`, `price-hikes`, `number of housing-permits`, `consumer sentiment index`, etc. (Not open-sourced; internship project).
4. A distributed [weather-reporting](https://github.com/airavata-courses/scapsulators) system deployed using microservices-architecture in Kubernetes cluster for real-time streaming of inference-reports via Kafka.
5. An in-house [master-data-management tool](https://github.com/vikrantdeshpande09876/Masterize_Hospital_Entities) to recursively parse and merge subsets of data while tracking transitive dependencies, and used the Levenshtein algorithm for string-comparisons.
6. An AI product to [detect weapons](https://github.com/vikrantdeshpande09876/Weapons-Detector-WUPHF) in CCTV/webcam footage and immediately notify authorities.
7. Bronze medal for [Revenue prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrantdeshpande098/gstore-cust-revenue-prediction) via a meta-model of Gradient-Boosting methods.
