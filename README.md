### Hello stranger 👋

<h2>You can call me Vikrant.</h2>


- 🔭 Currently leading a project to build a distributed [weather-reporting system](https://github.com/airavata-courses/scapsulators).
- 🌱 Always learning and growing as a [Data Scientist](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/9c/01/319c01608b5b7d0d9b6b875f39ae6938.jpg), [Data Engineer](https://miro.medium.com/max/645/1*VQfBYdqHe5Icb7Tj3iHpww.jpeg), and [Data Analyst](https://i.redd.it/yuh43yxmtpe31.jpg).
- 💬 Ask me about the world of data or astrophysics, and I promise something interesting.
- ⚡ I'm not always fun at parties, just ask me about `SQL`, `Python`, `R`, `Flask`, `SpringBoot`, `Docker` 🐳, `Bash`, and let's get it over with.
- 👯 Reach out if you're looking to collaborate on Machine Learning side projects, or need a partner for Leetcode problem-solving.
- ✨ Insert random inspirational quote: "The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take".
